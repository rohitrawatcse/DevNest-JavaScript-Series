Why Devsnest?

The only reason top tier colleges produce top-tier results is because they have been successful in building a learning environment conducive for growth. The faculty and infrastructure plays a very minor role. Students learn when they work with other students day in and day out - and it is never stressful!

They did an awesome job for the students who made it to those very few colleges - We do it for everyone

Apart from the 5-month course where we understand each and everything in all its depth, it's our super awesome community which is the real deal! All awesome students driven with passion for learning tech , work on Large scale projects, and so much more together. And the B in Devsnest stands for boredom - there ain't any!

What top-tier colleges did great for top 1% of students - we do it for everyone who is curious!
